# BlockChain_Project

Update 3/09/2018 Solved the chainIsValid method but no idea how

Update 3/09/2018 hash is not calculated perfectly in chain is valid method.
test data is given in test.js
you can check that.


Got less time pls in your command prompt add these line 
# cd 'location of the folder' without "'"
# npm i nodemon
# npm i express
# npm i sha256
